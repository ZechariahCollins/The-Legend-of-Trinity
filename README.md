An open-source multiplayer dungeon crawler video game inspired by the original Legend of Zelda!

Play the game here:
https://game.trinity.ix.tc

We are currently in the very beginning stages of game development.

The Legend of Zelda project for Harvard's CS50 course served as the foundation for our code. That repository is here:
https://github.com/games50/zelda

## Objective and Controls

Well, there currently is no clear objective! Kill enemies, trigger switches to open doorways, and explore the infinite dungeons. Again, we are early in the process of game development. As for controls, they are straight-forward:

* Move your character with the arrow keys
* Swing your sword using the spacebar

## Running Natively (Offline Play)

Our game is natively ran using love2d game engine. If you don't have love2d installed, choose your operating system and follow the installation instructions here:

https://love2d.org/

Assuming, you now have the engine installed, simply copy and paste one of the following commands in your terminal based on your operating system and the game should start running! 

### MacOS

```
git clone https://github.com/c-al3x/discountzelda.git && open discountzelda/zelda.love
```

### Windows

```
git clone https://github.com/c-al3x/discountzelda.git && ./discountzelda/zelda.love
```

### Linux

```
git clone https://github.com/c-al3x/discountzelda.git && xdg-open discountzelda/zelda.love
```

## Current Tips

* Don't play this using Google Chrome. (Will be fixed soon.)
* If you don't hear audio, you likely need to enable autoplay for our website in your browser.
* Yes, you may need to press "Enter" twice at the Start Menu.
* Playing in fullscreen is best.

### To Do

* Window resizing does not work
* No mobile support
* Player is normal size only when swinging sword
* Little original game design has been implemented
